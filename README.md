# applied-cryptography-labs-2023
My solutions to the lab tasks in the 8 credit Masterś course _Applied Cryptography_ course @ ETH Zürich, 2023.

This repository largely includes the necessary server files to test the solutions against locally.

No guarantee for correctness of these solutions! Some attacks in here are timing based and will require finetuning based on the connection, although this should not be an issue when testing locally.
