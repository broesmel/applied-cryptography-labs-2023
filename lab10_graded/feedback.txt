hello! thanks a lot for the labs, they were fun as always
the midterm was quite a shock to me. I do not understand 
why we are expected to know all of the lecture information
by heart. I can follow the exercises and do all of the 
reductions that we had to do so far with ease if I am 
allowed to lookup the exact definitions for the initial
games, but having to binge learn this only for the exam 
feels a bit sad. 

thanks anyways and best
