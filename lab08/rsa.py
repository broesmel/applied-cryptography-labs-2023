Textbook RSA works as follows:

KeyGen(nbits):

    Set e = 65537
    Choose two large primes p and q, such that gcd(e, p-1) = 1, gcd(e, q-1) = 1 and p != q
    Compute N=p * q where N has nbits bits
    Find d such that d * e = 1 (mod Î¦(N))
    (N,e) is the public key and (N,d) is the private key

Enc((N,e), m):

    Compute the ciphertext as c = m^e (mod N)

Dec((N,d), c):

    Compute the plaintext as p = c^d (mod N)
